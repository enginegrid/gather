  <p>
    Your community is not yet connected to Google Drive. To connect to Google Drive, please do the following:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Choose a Google Account that you'd like to connect to. You should choose one that doesn't belong
      to an individual. Something like <strong>yourcommunity@gmail.com</strong> is a good choice.
      Create a new Google Account if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all your community's files are contained inside a single "root" folder that is owned by or shared
      with your community's Google Account. Gather will only pay attention to the files inside that folder.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure your community's Google Account has at least "Editor"
      access to your folder and its subfolders. This is required for Gather to be able to
      help you manage permissions of your community's files. See
      <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7166529?hl=en&ref_topic=7000947">
        Google's help docs
      </a>
      for more information on how to change sharing settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure your community's Google Account has no "Starred" files in Google Drive.
      See <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310349?hl=en#4.4">this help document</a>
      for more information about "Starred" files. Gather uses the "Star" feature to keep track files during
      the import process.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Once you have done the above, click below to authenticate with Google. Be sure to sign in with the
    Google Account you chose above.
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= link_to("Authenticate With Google", @auth_url, class: "btn btn-primary") %>

    Your community is connected to Google Drive but you have not picked a root folder yet.
